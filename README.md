# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains implementations and practice problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It is organized into structured folders for **lab assignments** and **practice questions**, covering various DSA topics.

### ðŸ”¹ **Practice Folder**
Contains categorized problems for self-improvement and concept revision:
- **Advance Sorting**: Various sorting algorithms beyond basic ones (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Shell Sort, etc.).
- **Basics**: Fundamental programming and DSA concepts.
- **Graphs**: Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- **Hashing**: Hash functions, collision handling, and hash tables.
- **Heap**: Min-heap, max-heap, and priority queues.
- **Linked List**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with various operations.
- **Practice Questions**: General DSA problems for hands-on coding.
- **Recursion**: Recursive problem-solving approaches and applications.
- **Stack & Queue**: Implementation and applications of stacks and queues.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and tree traversal algorithms.

### ðŸ”¹ **Lab Assignments**
- Each **labX/** folder contains DSA-related assignments with **problem statements and solutions**.
- Solutions may include C++ implementations (without STL as per preference).
- Assignments cover fundamental to advanced topics, including sorting, searching, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
